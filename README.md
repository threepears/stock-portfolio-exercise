# Stock Portfolio Exercise

A NSS classroom project building a stock quote/portfolio app

### Goal

Create an app where you can look up stocks, buy them and add them to your portfolio, or sell them from your portfolio.  Stock lookup is implemented; portfolio and buy/sell feature was not completed. (This is a precursor to my final capstone project, Taking Stock.)

### Tools Used

Node, Express, Jade, Lodash, MongoDB, Mongoose, Nodemon, Bower, Code editor

### Installation

Create new repository and enter the following command:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/threepears/stock-portfolio-exercise.git
```

Run the following command to install all dependencies:

```sh
$ npm install
```

Now start your Mongo server in Terminal with this command:

```sh
$ mongod
```

Then start your regular Node server with this Terminal command:

```sh
$ npm run start
```

Now open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000/ to start and use the application!
